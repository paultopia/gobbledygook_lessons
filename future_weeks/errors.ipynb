Remember: Python indices start at 0, so in `[\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bear\"]` the only indices that exist are 0, 1, and 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages will actually let you access the index of their list-like data structures that is out of their range, and then just give you the contents of whatever is in memory at that location---which could (if the operating system sucks) be memory belonging to a different program, or it could be information that you don't want to be accessed in the current program.  \n",
    "Imagine, for example, that your program just holds a list of user information and also holds passwords, and you have some function that users can call to get at the user information, but you accidentally started counting at 1 instead of 0 (a common \"off-by-one error\") when you wrote the program. All of a sudden, users try to get the last item in their list, and they get a password back instead... maybe someone else's!  This is a contrived example, but it's not all that different from stuff that [really happens in languages like C](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mgxb/the-internet-has-a-huge-cc-problem-and-developers-dont-want-to-deal-with-it).\n",

    "First of all, **look at the type of the error, which is at the very bottom of the error message.**  Typically the last line is always the first place to look, and, in the error above, it should be pretty obvious what happened once you see it.  IndexError means, as expected, that you tried to use an index that doesn't exist.  Note that up above we helpfully get the line that caused the error.\n",
